#Localizations 0.1

Localizations is an OS X app that manages your Xcode project localization files (.strings).

Starting from a root folder - typically the project folder - it collects existing localizations data, re-generate new data using genstrings and ibtool, compute a diff and upon request, publishes the changes.
