# Contribute

I'm glad to see you want to help. Here are some of the ways you ca do that.

## Test Projects	
I am always in need for test projects. Projects with existing, partial string files and new, edited, deleted localizations.

To submit one, fork this repo, add your test project to the TestProjects folder and submit a PR with your expected results

## App Testing

Whenever you test Localizations and find a bug, a need for an improvement of anything else, please file them into the issues! That greatly helps me keep track of the roadmap.

## Bug Fixing/Feature adding
If you want to fix a bug or add a new feature, please follow this process:

- File the bug or feature request into the issues if not already,
- Fix/implement,
- Add (Xcode) Unit Tests and/or UI Tests,
- File a PR to merge into **pr\_landing\_strip** with reference to the issue and _describe the intention behind the PR_.

**In any cases, make sure your code has been tested thorougly**


#Thanks
I really appreciate all contributions, I made this tool because many in my surrounding needed it and I hope Localizations will belong to all of us.
